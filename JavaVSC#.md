# Java Versus C#
## Java
## C#
- C# is good at creating Microsoft destop apps.
- C# works best on .NET Framework, mono, Portable .NET framework, the implementation of CLI.
- C# is now more popular for the game development, even Vitual Reality.
## Java
- If the software is going to run on Linus, UNIX and other platform outside Microsft platform, Java is a better choice.
- New lanuage Scala, Groovy, Clojure are running on JVM.
## Similarity
- Both Java and C# is highly Object-Oriented languages providing various features.
- They are both type-safe 
- Both of them have in-build garbage collection mechanisum
- Both of them are single inheritence. This limits the side-effects of multi-inheritence.
- Both of them using interface to overcome the [diamond pattern](https://www.programmerinterview.com/c-cplusplus/diamond-problem/)
## Difference
- Java is a great option for building complex web-based, highly concurrent application whereas C# is ideal for game development, mobile development.
- Java is has huge of open-source ecosystem but C# can only run on the Microsoft platform.
- Java has both checked and unchecked exception but C# only has one typle exception
- Java enables polymorphisms by default, but C# need "virtual" and "Override" keyword.
- Enumeration in Java is more powerful than C#. Enumeration in Java is treated as a named instance of a type. 
It is easy to add customer behavior and private enums. In C#, Enumeration is just a list of named constants and should be integral under hood.
